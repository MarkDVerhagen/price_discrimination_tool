## The ethicality of personalized pricing, a commentary on Coker and Izaret (2020)
This tool is a companion to the paper 'Is Price Personalization Ethical? The Disutility of Unfairness Perception and Surveillance Aversion', which assesses an earlier paper by Coker and Izaret (2020) who show that under certain circumstances it can be socially desirable to charge different consumers different prices. In our paper we i) assess the generality of this claim by varying the various parameter assumptions made in the original paper, and ii) by including two behavioral components that can lead to disutility to the consumer as a result of personalized pricing (fairness perception and surveillance aversion). We show that the original claims by Coker and Izaret (2020) only hold under certain circumstances, and that small levels of disutility due to our two behavioral components can already mitigate any welfare gains due to personalized pricing.

Although we supply a large set of sensitivity analyses of the setup by Coker and Izaret (2020) in the paper, we cannot assess every single parameter combination. Therefore, we developed this tool such that the reader can try parameter combinations not currently showcased in the paper.
